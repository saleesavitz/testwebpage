            <p><strong>Positive Outlook</strong>: Technology is a broad field of research and development that changes everyday and has a major impact in our lives. 
                One of the most circulated topics in the current era of technology is virtual reality, which in short is technology that alters the very environment that we find ourselves in 
                In this report we aim to showcase the history of this type of technology including jobs pertaining to the subject and the many uses that virtual reality already has within our modern society; we also want to explore the social impact and the potential evolution and development of VR in our near future.
                We assure you that you will have a better understanding of these topics as you delve into our report.

            <p><strong>The first virtual invention</strong>: It was in 1929, when the first successful invention surrounding virtual reality was created.</p>

            <p><strong>Future of VR</strong>: As the creation of virtual reality continues to advance Tech companies will continue to develop new ways to integrate the use of their designs and into the modern world.  
                Companies such as Oculus are already enhancing the world's top companies through the use of VR headsets and the virtual experience with the intent to increase the companies productivity, reduce training costs, and enhance collaboration.Utilizing tools that allow a Virtual , Augmented, or Mixed Reality experience has the potential to advance companies for commerce but may also affect how individuals interact on a daily basis in the future .
                In the  article How augmented reality affects people's behavior by Stanford University, researchers found that people's interactions with a virtual person in augmented reality, or AR, influenced how they behaved and acted in the physical world.Virtual Reality is set to continue to advance and be integrated in different ways; while it does; continuing to explore the possible impact will be important.

            <p><strong>Social Impact of Virtual Reality</strong>: Virtual Reality affects society in various ways and can impact us positively and negatively. This form of technology is becoming more prevalent and when using it on a computer there is little to no movement needed, just sight and sound. 
                Virtual Reality is a software that allows you to use functions to communicate through video call, video games, in training, and in education. Virtual Reality is very beneficial when communicating online, it allows us to conduct meetings across the world. It also helps educate and train pilots in crash procedures without the dangers of crashing a plane or people getting injured (Henry, 2014). This is a safer way to train pilots and better prepare them for scenarios like this. 
                Not only is VR used for pilots but by the military, there are virtual boot camps, training, and simulations. VR allows pilots and soldiers to train for different scenarios and learn what they can improve upon before facing reality. Training with VR  significantly costs less and is a much faster process. It typically takes a year to achieve the same results you would in four months using VR training programs, it is very efficient and educational. Not only can you learn and connect through VR, but you are able to experience things you probably wouldn't be able to. 
                VR is very innovative, entertaining, and pleasurable software.

            <p><strong>Negative effects of Virtual Reality</strong>: Although Virtual Reality delivers a wide range of promising benefits that are tethered towards changing the scope of how we engage in education, technical training, and entertainment, there are also various negative drawbacks that it triggers. These negative drawbacks are primarily in the form of health risks that can be triggered as a result of wearing virtual reality headsets for an extensive period of time.
                These health risks include loss of spatial awareness, dizziness and disorientation, seizures, and nausea(Fagan,2018). Extended exposure to Virtual Reality can elicit cybersickness which is a form of motion sickness that can range from slight headaches to vomiting. Moreover, this ultimately occurs when wearing these headsets for a prolonged period of time.</p>

        <li style=color:blanchedalmond;>
            <p><strong>A brief look at Cybersickness</strong>: Depending on the specified content, on average 20%-95% of people experience some level of cybersickness when engaged in Virtual Reality. The symptoms commonly range from general discomfort, headaches, eye strain, nausea, sweating, disorientation, and experiences of vomiting at itâ€™s highest points. Adding to that, the symptoms experienced from prolonged exposure to virtual reality can last from minutes to days. Furthermore, it can even impose aftereffects ranging from altered hand-eye coordination, visual displacements,  postural ataxia(Frontiers, 2019). 
                A tragic, and horrid experience of the negative effects that VR can trigger when not utilized under correct guidance and restrictions could be depicted in a case in 2005. The case involved a young 22-year-old man who passed away due to cardiac arrest upon playing a game for 50 hours straight. 	</p>
